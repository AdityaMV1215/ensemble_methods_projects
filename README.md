# Ensemble methods project

Ensemble methods are learning algorithms that construct a. set of classifiers and then classify new data points
by taking a (weighted) vote of their predictions. In this project we will learn how to implement
few ensemble techniques which are used in the industry.

## What have we learnt so far ?
- What is ensembling?
- Types of ensembling
- Naive aggregation or voting
- Bootstrap Aggregating or Bagging
- Stacking

## What are we going to do in the project ?
- We will observe the bagging classifier model behaves and learns on training and testing dataset with the change
in no .of estimators.
- We will implement the stacking classifier and measure the accuracy of how our model performed.


## What will you learn by doing this project ?
- You will learn as to why ensemble methods are chosen and widely used now a days as they 
  - Average out the biases
  - Reduce the variance
  - Unlikely to overfit 
- You will be able to build your own stacking classifier with combination of more than one model and hence 
increase the accuracy of overall model performance.

### About the dataset 
The data set we are using in previous projects which is named as housing prices.
